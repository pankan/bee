  <div class="ai">Hi, how can I help you today?</div>
  <div class="user">I want to create a mobile app where users can send files from one device to another, regardless of whether they have internet access
  </div>
  <div class="ai">There are a few ways to create a mobile app that allows users to send files from one device to another without an internet connection. One approach is to use a technology called "peer-to-peer" (P2P) networking. P2P allows devices to connect directly to one another and share files without the need for a central server.
    Another approach is to use a technology called "Wi-Fi Direct." Wi-Fi Direct allows devices to connect to each other directly over Wi-Fi, without the need for a wireless access point. This can be used to send files from one device to another without an internet connection.
    You can also use Bluetooth to transfer files between devices.
    It is also important to consider the security and privacy of the files being transferred, and to implement appropriate measures such as encryption.
    You may want to consider using existing libraries or frameworks like Alljoyn, ShareIt, etc. to help you create your app.</div>
  <div class="cont">Here are some additional features that could enhance the user experience of your mobile app:
  </div>
  <div class="cont">
    <ol>
      <li>File transfer progress indicator <span> <br /> A progress bar or percentage indicator that shows how much of the file has been transferred.</span>
      </li>
      <li>Resumable transfers <span> <br /> The ability to pause and resume file transfers in case of interruption.</span>
      </li>
      <li>File transfer history <span> <br /> A feature that keeps a record of all the files that have been transferred through the app, along with the date and time of the transfer.</span></li>
      <li>Push notifications <span> <br />  Notify users when a file transfer is complete or when a file has been received.</span></li>
      <li>Multi-language support <span> <br />  The ability to support different languages for the app interface to reach wider audience.</span>
      <li>File compression <span> <br />  Allowing users to compress large files before sending them to save time and bandwidth.</span></li>
      </li>
      <li>File encryption <span> <br />  Provide the option to encrypt the files being transferred to keep them secure.</span>
      </li>
      <li>Multi-platform support <span> <br />  The ability to transfer files between different types of devices and platforms, such as iOS and Android.</span>
      </li>
      <li>Group file sharing <span> <br />  Allow multiple users to share and access files together.</span>
      </li>
      <li>Cloud integration <span> <br />  Allow users to transfer files to and from cloud storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.</span></li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div class="cont">
    These are just a few examples of features that could be added to enhance the user experience of your mobile app. You may find other features that would be useful or relevant to the particular use case of your app.</div>
  <div class="ai">Do you want me to show similar existing apps?</div>
  <div class="cont">
    <button class="yes">Yes</button>
    <button class="no">No</button>
  </div>
  <div class="cont">
    There are several existing apps that provide similar file transfer features, such as:
  </div>
  <div class="cont">
    <ol>
      <li>ShareIt <span> <br /> A popular cross-platform file transfer app that uses Wi-Fi Direct to transfer files between devices.</span></li>
      <li>Xender <span> <br /> A file transfer app that uses Wi-Fi Direct to transfer files and also allows group file sharing.</span>
      </li>
      <li>Zapya <span> <br /> A file transfer app that uses Wi-Fi Direct and also supports cloud integration with services like Dropbox and Google Drive.</span>
      </li>
      <li>Send Anywhere <span> <br /> A file transfer app that supports multiple platforms and uses a P2P network for file transfer.</span>
      </li>
      <li>File Transfer <span> <br /> A cross-platform file transfer app that uses Wi-Fi Direct and also supports file compression and encryption.</span>
      </li>
      <li>SuperBeam <span> <br /> A file transfer app that uses Wi-Fi Direct and also supports QR code scanning for easy file transfer.</span>
      </li>
      <li>AirDroid <span> <br /> A file transfer app that allows users to transfer files between their device and their computer over a local network.</span>
      </li>
      <li>Feem <span> <br /> A file transfer app that uses Wi-Fi Direct and also supports group file sharing.</span></li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div class="cont">
    These apps provide similar features to the ones you've mentioned in your checklist, and may serve as a good reference for your app. However, you should consider developing your app with different approach or adding new features to make it stand out from the competition.

    I can give you a general idea of the comparison between the features of those apps in table format, but please note that the specific features of each app can vary depending on the version and platform.
