    </div>
    <div class="ai">There are a few ways to create a mobile app that allows users to send files from one device to another without an internet connection. </div>
    <div class="cont">One approach is to use a technology called "peer-to-peer" (P2P) networking. P2P allows devices to connect directly to one another and share files without the need for a central server.</div>
    <div class="cont">Another approach is to use a technology called "Wi-Fi Direct." Wi-Fi Direct allows devices to connect to each other directly over Wi-Fi, without the need for a wireless access point. This can be used to send files from one device to another without an internet connection.</div>
    <div class="cont">It is also important to consider the security and privacy of the files being transferred, and to implement appropriate measures such as encryption.</div>
    <div class="cont">You may want to consider using existing libraries or frameworks like Alljoyn, ShareIt, etc. to help you create your app.</div>
    <div class="cont">Also some additional features will make your app experience richer.</div>
